# LEARNING PYTHON
This repository is dedicated to my path of refreshing my Python knowledge from years ago. I need to focus on the  tools that will allow me to achieve my goals.

In my studies and focus on moving into a professional software developer role and
indie hacker on the side, I've determined that I need to focus on getting in the door and that means
developing skills not with the new shiny tools, but the most productive and even legacy ones that have the
market share. That's PHP in the web and Python in most other places. So being that I already know Python, this will
be my path of "re-learning" this popular and very productive language and getting come certificates to that
point along the way.
